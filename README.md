## Object-Detection from Images and Videos

 It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function  is trained from a lot of positive and negative images (where positive images are those where the object to be detected is present, negative are those where it is not). It is then used to detect objects in other images. OpenCV offers pre-trained ##### Haar cascade algorithms, organized into categories (faces, eyes and so forth), depending on the images they have been trained on.
